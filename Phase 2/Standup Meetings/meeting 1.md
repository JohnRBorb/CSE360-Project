# Standup Meeting Description

## No recording was made due to limited number of team members for the meeting

### Today's Standup Meeting was short, setting our team up for Phase 2 of the project and making sure those in attendance understood what the project asked of us. For those who didn't attend, the below directions are given so they can see it as soon as possible.

"The plan is we have another meeting around ~8:30-9:00 tomorrow through Zoom. The meeting will be going over the tasks (bullet points on the phase 2 page on Canvas) we need to complete. We have 6 people and 6 requirements for the system with the Student implementation, so the idea is to divide each task to each person. We'll decide that tomorrow. 

Before then, look over the Canvas page for phase 2 of the project and decide which task you think you could do best. A lot of the tasks are things we have already done in HW2 but will just need to be refined and be consistent. You may be okay with doing any of them, or at least a few, but that can be figured out more in the meeting tomorrow.

We'll also need to look at each other's implementations of HW2 and decide which one is the best and which one we should build upon and refine. Ideally everyone will be there so we can all see our implementations at that time and come to a decision sooner than later. If you can't make it, you can probably record your implementation and post it here so we can see it, as well as deciding which tasks you want to handle."
